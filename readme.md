### Conclusion
To conclude, through this final assignment, the internship program has taught me a lot of things related to backend development, including creating REST APIs, managing a database, handling authentication, setting up a REST API development environment, and above all, writing codes that do all these things cleanly. Additionally, the internship program also has given me an idea of what backend engineer work looks like. In my opinion, the program, especially the final assignment, is designed quite well and is a great resource to enrich insight related to backend development.
