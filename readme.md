### Conclusion
To conclude, the internship program has taught me a lot of things related to backend development, including creating REST APIs, managing a database and its transactions, handling authentication, setting up a development work environment, and above all, writing codes doing all these things cleanly. Additionally, through this final assignment, it also has given me an idea of what backend engineer work looks like. In my opinion, the program, especially the final assignment, has been designed quite well and is a great resource to enrich insight related to backend development.
